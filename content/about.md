I’m a dad, a retired judge, a guitar player, a former state representative, an amateur programmer and statistician. Out of fear that some may take my posts too seriously, I describe myself as someone who does mostly exploratory analysis and visualization--although I have ventured into predictive analytics and modeling from time to time.

The death of analytical/investigative reporting at the regional and local level often leads me into controversial areas like public policy.  Favorite and familiar areas are maternal health,  economics and, most recently, conservation.

In short, I’m interested in learning about the world in a more mathematical, objective and firsthand way. And that is why I blog.
